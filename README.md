I’m an R enthusiast. I have been using R professionally since I
graduated in 2005. The R language has always been my first choice, and
to this day I haven’t reached a limit thanks to R
(<https://www.r-project.org/>).

As equity portfolio manager and quantitative analyst in the financial
center of Zurich, I came across various models and method in the
different fields of quantitative finance.

My main interests are:

-   Equity portfolio management
-   Portfolio optimization
-   Risk management
-   Derivatives
-   Process and business automation

The capabilities of R in combination with a SQL database allow to solve
almost any quantitative finance problem. The speed at which you can
build prototypes in R and SQL is tremendous. That’s why I’m a huge R
enthusiast.
